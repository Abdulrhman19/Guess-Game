+ STEPS:
    1- Ask the user for difficulty level 
    and store it in a variable.
    2- Make a decision based on level:
        if level is 1:
            range = 25
        if level is 2:
            range is 50
        if level is 3:
            range = 100
    3- define a var called number which hold a random integer in range.
    4- Define a temp var to handle user guessing inputs.
    5- Make a decision based on temp variable:
        if temp > number:
            print "To high"
        if temp < number:
            print "To low"
        if temp == number:
            print "You got it, congratulations"
    6- ask the user if they want to play more or terminate the game.
    7- if they want, then ask if they would play with the same difficulty level.
    8- redo all the steps above.
